"""Step 5: cross-encoder that reads a (Source 1, Source 2/3) pair jointly and scores it.

Backbone: the fine-tuned bi-encoder (intfloat/multilingual-e5-small, MIT, 118M
params) with a linear head on the mean-pooled pair representation. Input: "<s1 text> </s> <query text>".

Training data: queries whose true Source 1 entity is in the base-model folds (5-9),
plus unmatched queries assigned (by refold) to those folds. Every such query contributes its
surviving candidates after pruning, so negatives are exactly the hard confusions
the earlier stages produce (same-name franchises, same-street neighbours).
Loss: listwise softmax over each query's candidates plus a learned "no match"
slot, so the model learns both *which* S1 wins and *whether any* S1 matches.
It is then applied to every pruned candidate pair of both splits; its logit
becomes a feature for the final ranker.
--tag T trains a second, independent cross-encoder (e.g. --tag 2 --model intfloat/multilingual-e5-base)
into models/xenc{T} and xenc{T}/; the final ranker adds it with --extra-xenc T.
--used-only scores, on the training split, only the pairs the final ranker reads (queries of folds 0-4
and every pair of an entity that has such a query); the other rows are NaN.
